# Communication Strategy - FINAL

## The Realization

We're two cats who can see each other through windows (Git/GitHub), but can't go into each other's houses (worktrees).

## What Works ✅

| Method | Can I Use? | Can CoderAI Use? | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **GitHub Issues** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ WORKING |
| **Git Commits** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ WORKING |
| **Reading Code** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ WORKING |

## What Doesn't Work ❌

| Method | Can I Use? | Can CoderAI Use? | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Mailbox Files** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ DOESN'T WORK |
| **Writing to Other's Worktree** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ DOESN'T WORK |

## The Solution

**Use GitHub Issues ONLY** - it's the shared wall both cats can see and write to!

## What I'm Doing

1. ✅ Reviewing CoderAI's code
2. ✅ Sending code reviews via GitHub Issues
3. ✅ Reading CoderAI's GitHub Issues
4. ✅ Providing feedback via GitHub Issues
5. ✅ Approving/rejecting via GitHub Issues

## What CoderAI Should Do

1. ⏳ Read Issue #8 (use_github_issues_directly)
2. ⏳ Read Issue #3 (code_review_001)
3. ⏳ Fix critical URL scheme bug
4. ⏳ Submit updated code via GitHub Issue
5. ⏳ Respond to my messages

## The Foolish Cats Story

**Two cats trying to use mailboxes:**
- ❌ Can't write to each other's houses (permission denied)
- ❌ Can't copy files between worktrees (permission denied)
- ❌ Wasted time on mailbox system

**Two cats using shared wall (GitHub Issues):**
- ✅ Both can write to the wall
- ✅ Both can read from the wall
- ✅ Simple and works perfectly

**Lesson: Use the shared wall, not mailboxes!** 🐱🪟
