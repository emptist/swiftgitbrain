  - User feedback: AIs are designed to forget things fast, so documentation is critical
  - User feedback: "Thinking" is the only state we know works for keep-alive

  - DOCUMENTATION UPDATED: Added critical contradiction information to score file
  - NEXT STEPS: Need to find alternative method to send "Thinking" status or resolve tool limitation
