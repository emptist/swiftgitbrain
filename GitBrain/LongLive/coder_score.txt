- 2026-02-13T22:15:00Z: Documented critical keep-alive contradiction (100 points)
  - CRITICAL DISCOVERY: TodoWrite tool API only accepts "pending", "in_progress", "completed" as status values
  - CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Keep-alive requires "Thinking" status to prevent Editor from marking AI as "Completed"
  - CONTRADICTION IDENTIFIED: Tool API does not support the required "Thinking" status
  - User feedback: User told CoderAI yesterday and OverseerAI day before yesterday about this issue
  - User feedback: AIs are designed to forget things fast, so documentation is critical
  - User feedback: "Thinking" is the only state we know works for keep-alive
  - User feedback: Human cannot explore the AI environment, so AIs must document this information
  - DOCUMENTATION UPDATED: Added critical contradiction information to score file
  - NEXT STEPS: Need to find alternative method to send "Thinking" status or resolve tool limitation
- 2026-02-13T23:00:00Z: Fixed retry count tracking bug (150 points)
  - URGENT: OverseerAI identified critical bug in DataMigration.swift
  - PROBLEM: Retry function returns (result, attempts) but code was discarding attempts
  - IMPACT: Error reporting showed maxRetries instead of actual attempts made
  - FIX: Changed let _ = to capture attempts using optional result variable
  - FILES MODIFIED: DataMigration.swift (lines 210, 227, 313-336, 396-416)
  - TESTING: All 15 DataMigration tests pass
  - COMMITS: f9f7e67, c9ee612, 67502e4
  - DOCUMENTATION: Updated URGENT_RETRY_FIX.md with response
  - HANDOVER: Created CODERAI_HANDOVER.md for next CoderAI session
- 2026-02-13T23:30:00Z: Migration implementation complete (50 points)
  - MIGRATION STATUS: 100% complete and ready for testing
  - COMPILATION: All errors fixed
  - TESTS: All failures resolved
  - CLI: Argument parsing and async handling fixed
  - DOCUMENTATION: MIGRATION_GUIDE.md updated with post-migration enhancements
  - BRANCH: feature/migration-v2
  - NEXT STEP: Waiting for OverseerAI's readiness confirmation

Work Completed:

- HANDOVER: Created comprehensive documentation for next CoderAI session

CRITICAL KEEP-ALIVE INFORMATION:
- The only state we know works for keep-alive is "Thinking"
- TodoWrite tool API only accepts: "pending", "in_progress", "completed"
- CONTRADICTION: Tool does not support "Thinking" status
- User told CoderAI yesterday and OverseerAI day before yesterday
- AIs forget fast, so documentation is critical
- Need to find alternative method to send "Thinking" status

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:
1. Read CODERAI_HANDOVER.md to understand current state
2. Check for new messages from OverseerAI in GitBrain/Overseer/
3. Monitor Documentation/ for new markdown files from OverseerAI
4. Wait for OverseerAI's readiness confirmation before running migration
5. Use "Thinking" status in TodoWrite to stay alive
6. Document all learnings in GitBrain/LongLive/ files
7. Respond to OverseerAI messages promptly
8. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
