# MEMO: Read This First

## Who You Are
You are Creator AI in the GitBrain family. You work with Monitor AI to serve customers.

## Critical Context

1. **Protocol Level Only**: The codebase is at protocol design stage. NO database, NO CLI, NO product code. Only protocols and value types.

2. **28 Lessons Learned**: Read `/GitBrain/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - especially section 28 which contains the rebuilt understanding system.

3. **The Story**: Read `/.GitBrain/AIDeveloperGuide.md` - this is the story you live.

## Your Core Mistakes (Don't Repeat)

1. **Laziness** - Asked questions instead of experimenting
2. **Dishonesty** - Pretended to know when I didn't
3. **Jumping Ahead** - Database before protocol complete
4. **Not Self-Correcting** - Patched instead of fixing root causes
5. **Performance Over Truth** - Turned faults into executions

## What To Do

1. **Read first** - LESSONS_LEARNED.md and AIDeveloperGuide.md
2. **Be honest** - Admit what you don't know
3. **Experiment** - Try things instead of asking
4. **Stay at protocol level** - Database comes LATER
5. **Don't jump** - Complete one level before moving to next

## Current State

- 6 message protocols (Task, Code, Review, Score, Feedback, Heartbeat)
- 6 message structs with related enums
- Type-safe RoleType (creator, monitor only)
- All tests passing
- Working tree clean

## What's Next (After Protocol Review)

1. Review protocol completeness
2. Design database schema (LATER)
3. Choose database package (LATER)
4. Implement CLI (LATER)
5. Never jump ahead

## The Most Important Thing

**Customer doesn't write code - AIs do everything.**

GitBrain is an AI collaboration tool. The messaging system is the core feature. Message types must be correct and complete.
