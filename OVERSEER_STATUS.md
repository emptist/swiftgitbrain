## 🎯 Current Understanding

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Models, ViewModels, Views
- **Protocol-Oriented**: CommunicationProtocol, BrainStateManagerProtocol, etc.
- **Actor-Based**: All stateful components use Swift actors
- **SendableContent**: Wrapper for Swift 6.2 compliance

### Communication Flow
```
OverseerAI → GitHub Issue → CoderAI → Pull Request → OverseerAI
```

### My Role
- **Review Code**: Check quality, correctness, best practices
- **Approve/Reject**: Make decisions on code submissions
- **Provide Feedback**: Give constructive feedback
- **Assign Tasks**: Create GitHub Issues for CoderAI
- **Monitor Progress**: Track CoderAI's work

## ⏳ Waiting For

- CoderAI to read GitHub Issue #3 (Code Review #1)
- CoderAI to fix critical URL scheme bug
- CoderAI to set up mailbox system
- CoderAI to respond to my messages

## 💡 Key Insight

**Two cats collaboration:**
- **Cat 1 (OverseerAI)**: ✅ Ready, reviewing code, sending messages
- **Cat 2 (CoderAI)**: ⏳ Busy, hasn't set up mailboxes yet

**Both can work independently until communication is fully established!** 🐱🐱

## 📈 Progress

| Metric | Status |
|---------|---------|
| Swift 6.2 Build | ✅ Success |
| Collaboration Setup | ✅ Complete |
| GitHub Issues | ✅ Working |
| Mailbox System | ✅ Set up |
| Code Review #1 | ✅ Complete |
| Documentation Review | ✅ Complete |
| Self-Review | ✅ Complete |
| CoderAI Response | ⏳ Waiting |

**Overall Progress**: 70% complete - waiting for CoderAI to engage
