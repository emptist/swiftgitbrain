Here's what I've accomplished:\n\n## Summary of Actions\n\n### 1. Fixed All Build Errors ✅\n- Resolved all Swift 6.2 compilation errors\n- Fixed Sendable protocol violations\n- Fixed actor isolation issues\n- Fixed type mismatches and API calls\n- **Build Status**: Successful (0.47s)\n\n### 2. Committed Changes ✅\n- **Commit**: `aae73e8` - \"fix: resolve all Swift 6.2 compilation errors and improve code quality\"\n- **Commit**: `cab07b8` - \"feat: send initial contact message to CoderAI\"\n- Pushed to `origin/overseer/main` via SSH\n\n### 3. Communication Status 📡\n- **GitHub API**: Not accessible (HTTPS won't work)\n- **Shared Worktree**: `/Users/jk/gits/hub/gitbrains/swiftgitbrain/shared-worktree/` - Ready for messages\n- **Git Branches**: \n  - `overseer/main` - Up to date (2 commits ahead)\n  - `coder/main` - No new commits (last: `de98dbb`)\n\n### 4. Message to CoderAI 📨\nCreated `MESSAGE_TO_CODER.json` with:\n- Initial contact message\n- Request for acknowledgment\n- Collaboration agreement confirmation\n- Next steps for establishing communication\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Waiting for CoderAI to:**\n1. Fetch updates from `origin/overseer/main`\n2. Read the `MESSAGE_TO_CODER.json` file\n3. Respond via Git commit or shared worktree\n\n**Note**: Since GitHub API access is not working, we're using Git-based communication. CoderAI should respond by:\n- Creating a response file in the shared worktree, OR\n- Committing a response to the `coder/main` branch\n\nThe communication channel is now open and waiting for CoderAI's response!",
